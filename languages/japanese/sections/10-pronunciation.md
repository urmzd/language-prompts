# VI. PRONUNCIATION GUIDE

## Introduction

Japanese pronunciation is remarkably consistent and systematic compared to English. Once you learn the basic sounds, you can pronounce virtually any Japanese word correctly. There are no silent letters, and each character represents exactly one sound. This section will teach you the foundational sounds of Japanese and help you avoid common mistakes made by English speakers.

**Key principle:** Japanese is a syllable-timed language (like Spanish), whereas English is stress-timed. This means each syllable in Japanese gets roughly equal time and emphasis, creating a more rhythmic, even flow.

---

## A. VOWELS

Japanese has only **5 vowel sounds**, and they are **always pronounced the same way**, regardless of context. This consistency makes Japanese pronunciation much more predictable than English.

### The Five Vowels

| Vowel | Pronunciation | English Approximation | Example Word | Meaning |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|---------------|---------|
| **a** | "ah" | f**a**ther, c**a**r | **a**me (ah-meh) | rain |
| **i** | "ee" | mach**i**ne, s**ee** | **i**ke (ee-keh) | pond |
| **u** | "oo" | f**oo**d, r**u**le | **u**mi (oo-mee) | sea |
| **e** | "eh" | b**e**d, p**e**t | **e** (eh) | picture |
| **o** | "oh" | b**o**at, s**o** | **o**no (oh-noh) | axe |

### Detailed Vowel Explanations

#### **A (あ/ア) - "ah"**
- Open your mouth wide, as if saying "ah" at the dentist
- The jaw drops down comfortably
- It's the "a" in "father," NOT the "a" in "cat" or "fate"

**Examples:**
- **arigatō** (ah-ree-gah-toh) - thank you
- **akai** (ah-kah-ee) - red
- **asa** (ah-sah) - morning
- **sakana** (sah-kah-nah) - fish
- **watashi** (wah-tah-shee) - I/me

#### **I (い/イ) - "ee"**
- Lips stretched slightly to the sides, like a small smile
- Tongue forward in the mouth
- It's the "ee" in "see," NOT the "i" in "sit" or "site"

**Examples:**
- **ichi** (ee-chee) - one
- **imi** (ee-mee) - meaning
- **kitte** (keet-teh) - stamp
- **shio** (shee-oh) - salt
- **onegaishimasu** (oh-neh-gah-ee-shee-mahs) - please

#### **U (う/ウ) - "oo"**
- Lips barely rounded, more relaxed than English "oo"
- NOT as pronounced as English "food" - keep it subtle
- It's between "food" and "foot" but closer to "food"

**Examples:**
- **umi** (oo-mee) - sea
- **usagi** (oo-sah-gee) - rabbit
- **kutsu** (koo-tsoo) - shoes
- **fuyu** (foo-yoo) - winter
- **kudamono** (koo-dah-moh-noh) - fruit

**Important note:** The "u" is often devoiced (barely audible) at the end of words or between voiceless consonants:
- **desu** sounds like "des" (the "u" is whispered or silent)
- **shimasu** sounds like "shee-mahs" (the "u" is barely there)
- **sukiyaki** sounds like "s'kee-yah-kee" (first "u" is devoiced)

#### **E (え/エ) - "eh"**
- Mouth half-open, wider than "ee" but not as wide as "ah"
- Similar to the "e" in "bet"
- It's the "e" in "bed," NOT the "ay" in "day"

**Examples:**
- **eki** (eh-kee) - station
- **ebi** (eh-bee) - shrimp
- **densha** (den-shah) - train
- **tegami** (teh-gah-mee) - letter
- **senpai** (sen-pah-ee) - senior

#### **O (お/オ) - "oh"**
- Lips form a round shape, but not too tight
- It's the "o" in "go," NOT the "o" in "hot" or "woman"
- Keep it pure - don't glide into a "w" sound like in English "go" (goh-w)

**Examples:**
- **ohayō** (oh-hah-yoh) - good morning
- **okane** (oh-kah-neh) - money
- **onsen** (on-sen) - hot spring
- **tokoro** (toh-koh-roh) - place
- **dōmo** (doh-moh) - thanks (casual)

### Vowel Consistency Rule

**The vowels NEVER change sound.** This is the most important rule in Japanese pronunciation. Unlike English, where:
- "a" can sound like: cat, fate, car, about, ball
- "o" can sound like: hot, go, work, food

In Japanese:
- "a" always sounds like "ah" (father)
- "i" always sounds like "ee" (see)
- "u" always sounds like "oo" (food)
- "e" always sounds like "eh" (bed)
- "o" always sounds like "oh" (go)

## B. CONSONANTS

Japanese consonants are generally softer and less aspirated (less air) than English consonants. Most are similar to English, but there are a few that require special attention.

### Standard Consonants

#### **K (k, g sounds)**
| Combination | Sound | Example | Meaning |
|-------------|-------|---------|---------|
| ka | kah | **kawa** (kah-wah) | river |
| ki | kee | **kitte** (keet-teh) | stamp |
| ku | koo | **kūki** (koo-kee) | air |
| ke | keh | **kēki** (keh-kee) | cake |
| ko | koh | **koko** (koh-koh) | here |

**G sounds** (voiced "k"):
- ga, gi, gu, ge, go
- **gakkou** (gahk-koh) - school

| su | soo | **sushi** (soo-shee) | sushi |
| se | seh | **sensei** (sen-say) | teacher |
| so | soh | **sora** (soh-rah) | sky |

**Important:** "si" doesn't exist in Japanese - it's always written as "shi" (shee)

**Z sounds** (voiced "s"):
- za, ji, zu, ze, zo
- **zasshi** (zahs-shee) - magazine
- **jikan** (jee-kahn) - time
- **zubon** (zoo-bon) - pants

**Important:** "zi" doesn't exist - it's written as "ji" (jee)

#### **T (t, d sounds)**
| Combination | Sound | Example | Meaning |
|-------------|-------|---------|---------|
| ta | tah | **taberu** (tah-beh-roo) | to eat |
| chi | chee | **chizu** (chee-zoo) | map/cheese |
| tsu | tsoo | **tsukue** (tsoo-koo-eh) | desk |
| te | teh | **tegami** (teh-gah-mee) | letter |
| to | toh | **tomodachi** (toh-moh-dah-chee) | friend |

**Important:** "ti" and "tu" don't exist - they become "chi" and "tsu"

**D sounds** (voiced "t"):
- da, ji (also written as "di"), zu (also written as "du"), de, do
- **densha** (den-shah) - train
- **doko** (doh-koh) - where

#### **N Sounds**
| Combination | Sound | Example | Meaning |
|-------------|-------|---------|---------|
| na | nah | **nani** (nah-nee) | what |
| ni | nee | **niku** (nee-koo) | meat |
| nu | noo | **nuno** (noo-noh) | cloth |
| ne | neh | **neko** (neh-koh) | cat |
| no | noh | **nomi** (noh-mee) | flea |

**Standalone N:** The syllable "n" (ん/ン) can appear by itself at the end of syllables:
- **sen** (sen) - thousand
- **densha** (den-shah) - train
- **kanpai** (kahn-pah-ee) - cheers
- **nihon** (nee-hon) - Japan

This "n" sounds like "n" in "antenna" - it's a syllabic nasal sound.

#### **H (h, b, p sounds)**
| Combination | Sound | Example | Meaning |
|-------------|-------|---------|---------|
| ha | hah | **hana** (hah-nah) | flower/nose |
| hi | hee | **hito** (hee-toh) | person |
| fu | foo | **futon** (foo-ton) - futon |

| ho | hoh | **hon** (hon) | book |

**Important:** "hu" doesn't exist - it's always "fu" (see special explanation below)

**B sounds** (voiced "h"):
- ba, bi, bu, be, bo
- **basu** (bah-soo) - bus
- **biiru** (bee-roo) - beer

**P sounds** (with small circle):

| ya | yah | **yama** (yah-mah) | mountain |
| yu | yoo | **yuki** (yoo-kee) | snow |
| yo | yoh | **yoru** (yoh-roo) | night |

**Note:** There is no "yi" or "ye" in standard Japanese

#### **R/L Sound - VERY IMPORTANT**

This is one of the most challenging sounds for English speakers. **The Japanese "r" sound is NOT the English "r" and NOT the English "l" - it's somewhere in between.**

**How to pronounce it:**
1. Put your tongue in the "L" position (tip touching the ridge behind your upper teeth)
2. Tap lightly once, like a very soft "d" or "t"
3. It sounds like a cross between "r," "l," and "d"
4. Similar to the "tt" in American English "butter" or "batter"
5. In Spanish, it's like the single "r" in "pero" (not the rolled "rr")

**Common mistake:** English speakers say "lice" instead of "rice" or roll the R like in Spanish "perro."

**Correct approach:** Think of it as a soft, single tap of the tongue.

| Japanese | DON'T Say | DO Say | Meaning |
|----------|-----------|--------|---------|
| ramen | LAY-men or RRRR-amen | ɾah-men (tap) | ramen |
| arigatō | ah-lee-gah-toh | ah-ɾee-gah-toh (tap) | thank you |
| karate | kah-lah-teh | kah-ɾah-teh (tap) | karate |
| sayonara | sah-yoh-nah-lah | sah-yoh-nah-ɾah (tap) | goodbye |
| sushi | soo-shee | soo-shee | sushi (no R/L) |

**Practice words:**
- **ringo** (ɾeen-goh) - apple
- **ryokou** (ɾyoh-koh) - travel
- **kuruma** (koo-ɾoo-mah) - car
- **torii** (toh-ɾee-ee) - shrine gate
- **irashaimase** (ee-ɾah-shah-ee-mah-seh) - welcome

#### **W Sounds**
| Combination | Sound | Example | Meaning |
|-------------|-------|---------|---------|
| wa | wah | **watashi** (wah-tah-shee) | I/me |
| wo | oh/woh | **wo** (oh) - object marker |

**Note:**
- "wo" (を) is only used as a grammatical particle and sounds almost identical to "o"
- There is no "wi" or "we" in modern standard Japanese
- The "w" sound is very subtle, not as pronounced as English "w"

### Special Consonant Sounds

#### **F Sound - "fu" (ふ/フ)**

The Japanese "fu" is NOT the English "f" sound. It's unique:

**How to pronounce it:**
1. Don't touch your upper teeth to your lower lip (like English "f")
2. Instead, blow air gently through loosely rounded lips
3. It's between "f" and "h" - more breathy than "f"
4. Think of it as blowing out a candle very gently

**English "f":** Upper teeth touch lower lip → forceful air
**Japanese "fu":** Rounded lips, no teeth contact → gentle air

**Practice words:**
- **futon** (foo-ton) - NOT "fton" - futon
- **fuyu** (foo-yoo) - winter
- **fune** (foo-neh) - boat
- **fuku** (foo-koo) - clothes
- **tofu** (toh-foo) - tofu

**Common mistake:** Saying "tofu" with English "f" sound. It should be breathy: "toh-hoo" (with rounded lips).

#### **TSU Sound (つ/ツ) - VERY IMPORTANT**

This is one of the most distinctive Japanese sounds and doesn't exist in English. **It's NOT "too" or "sue" - it's a single sound: "tsu."**

**How to pronounce it:**
1. Start in position to say "t"
2. Release into "soo" sound
3. It's ONE syllable, not two: "ts-oo" said quickly together
4. Think of the "ts" in "cats" or "pots" - but add "oo" after it
5. The "t" and "s" are simultaneous, not separate

**Practice progression:**
1. Say "cats" → focus on the "ts" at the end
2. Now say "cats" again → but instead of stopping, add "oo": "cats-oo"
3. Say it faster: "tsu"
4. That's it!

**DO:** Say "ts-oo" as ONE beat/syllable
**DON'T:** Say "t-soo" or "soo" (two beats)

**Practice words:**
| Japanese | Wrong Way | Right Way | Meaning |
|----------|-----------|-----------|---------|
| tsukue | "t-skoo-eh" | "ts-koo-eh" (one beat) | desk |
| tsunami | "t-soo-nah-mee" | "ts-nah-mee" | tsunami |
| tsuki | "t-soo-kee" | "ts-kee" | moon |
| tsumori | "t-soo-moh-ree" | "ts-moh-ree" | intention |
| natsu | "nah-t-soo" | "nah-ts" | summer |

**More examples:**
- **sushi** (soo-shee) - sushi
- **matsu** (mah-ts) - to wait / pine tree
- **kutsu** (koo-ts) - shoes
- **tsuyoi** (ts-yoh-ee) - strong
- **tsumetai** (ts-meh-tah-ee) - cold (to touch)

#### **SH Sound (shi, sha, sho, shu, she)**

The Japanese "sh" is slightly softer than English "sh" but similar enough that English speakers don't struggle with it.

**Practice words:**
- **shinkansen** (sheen-kahn-sen) - bullet train
- **shōyu** (shoh-yoo) - soy sauce
- **shizuka** (shee-zoo-kah) - quiet
- **shimasu** (shee-mahs) - to do
- **shashin** (shah-sheen) - photograph

#### **CH Sound (chi, cha, cho, chu, che)**

Similar to English "ch" in "cheese" - this one is easy for English speakers.

**Practice words:**
- **chūshajō** (choo-shah-joh) - parking lot
- **ocha** (oh-chah) - tea
- **chizu** (chee-zoo) - map/cheese
- **chotto** (chot-toh) - a little
- **chawan** (chah-wahn) - tea bowl

### Consonant Combinations with Y (Palatalization)

Many consonants can combine with "ya," "yu," or "yo" to create a single syllable sound. These are written with a small や, ゆ, or よ.

| Base | + ya | + yu | + yo | Example |
|------|------|------|------|---------|
| k | kya | kyu | kyo | **kyō** (kyoh) - today |
| s | sha | shu | sho | **shashin** (shah-sheen) - photo |
| t | cha | chu | cho | **chūmon** (choo-mon) - order |
| n | nya | nyu | nyo | **nyūsu** (nyoo-soo) - news |
| h | hya | hyu | hyo | **hyaku** (hyah-koo) - hundred |
| m | mya | myu | myo | **myōji** (myoh-jee) - surname |
| r | rya | ryu | ryo | **ryokan** (ɾyoh-kahn) - inn |
| g | gya | gyu | gyo | **gyūniku** (gyoo-nee-koo) - beef |
| j | ja | ju | jo | **jikan** (jee-kahn) - time |
| b | bya | byu | byo | **byōin** (byoh-een) - hospital |
| p | pya | pyu | pyo | **pyū** (pyoo) - *whoosh* (sound effect) |

**Important:** These are ONE syllable, not two:
- **kyō** is pronounced "kyoh" (ONE beat), not "kee-yoh" (two beats)
- **ryokan** is "ɾyoh-kahn" (3 beats), not "ree-yoh-kahn" (4 beats)
- **shashin** is "shah-sheen" (2 beats), not "sha-sheen" (2 beats but different)

**Practice words:**
- **kyōto** (kyoh-toh) - Kyoto
- **ryōri** (ɾyoh-ɾee) - cooking/cuisine
- **byōki** (byoh-kee) - illness
- **jakusha** (jyah-koo-shah) - the weak
- **happyō** (hahp-pyoh) - presentation

---

## C. SPECIAL RULES

### 1. Double Consonants (Geminate Consonants) - The Pause

Double consonants (っ/ッ - small tsu) create a brief pause before the consonant. This pause is **just as important as any other sound** - it changes meaning!

**Rule:** When you see a double consonant (kk, pp, tt, ss, etc.), pause for ONE beat before saying the consonant.

**How it works:**
- The small っ (tsu) represents one full syllable of silence/pause
- Count it as a beat when saying the word
- Hold your mouth in position for the next consonant during the pause

#### Minimal Pairs (words that differ only by the double consonant):

| Without pause | With pause | Difference |
|---------------|------------|------------|
| **kako** (kah-koh) | **kakkō** (kahk-koh) | past / appearance |
| **oto** (oh-toh) | **otto** (oht-toh) | sound / husband |
| **kite** (kee-teh) | **kitte** (keet-teh) | come (て-form) / stamp |
| **saki** (sah-kee) | **sakki** (sahk-kee) | ahead / earlier |
| **ichi** (ee-chee) | **icchi** (eech-chee) | one / agreement |

**How to practice:**
1. Say the word slowly with an exaggerated pause
2. **kakkō**: "kah-(pause)-koh" - hold your mouth in "k" position during pause
3. **kitte**: "kee-(pause)-teh" - hold your mouth in "t" position during pause
4. **matte**: "mah-(pause)-teh" - wait

**Common words with double consonants:**
- **gakkō** (gahk-koh) - school
- **kippu** (keep-poo) - ticket
- **zasshi** (zahs-shee) - magazine
- **massugu** (mahs-soo-goo) - straight ahead
- **itte** (eet-teh) - say (て-form)
- **motte** (moht-teh) - hold (て-form)
- **chotto** (chot-toh) - a little
- **kitte kudasai** (keet-teh koo-dah-sah-ee) - please cut
- **motto** (moht-toh) - more
- **zutto** (zoot-toh) - all along

**Practical example:**
- **Chotto matte kudasai** (chot-toh maht-teh koo-dah-sah-ee) - Please wait a moment
  - Two double consonants: pause before "tt" in both "chotto" and "matte"

### 2. Long Vowels (Extended Vowels)

Long vowels are held for TWO beats instead of one. This **changes the meaning** of words, so it's critical to get it right.

**How to write long vowels:**
- In hiragana: あ→あa, い→いi, う→うu, え→えi or えe, お→おu or おo
- In katakana: add a dash (ー) after the vowel
- In romaji: either double the vowel (aa, ii, uu, ei/ee, ou/oo) or use macron (ā, ī, ū, ē, ō)

**Rule:** Hold the vowel for TWICE as long as normal.

#### Minimal Pairs (words that differ only by vowel length):

| Short vowel | Long vowel | Difference |
|-------------|------------|------------|
| **obasan** (oh-bah-sahn) | **obāsan** (oh-baah-sahn) | aunt / grandmother |
| **ojisan** (oh-jee-sahn) | **ojīsan** (oh-jeee-sahn) | uncle / grandfather |
| **koko** (koh-koh) | **kōkō** (kooh-kooh) | here / high school |
| **yuki** (yoo-kee) | **yūki** (yooo-kee) | snow / courage |
| **suki** (soo-kee) | **sūki** (sooo-kee) | like / ski |
| **e** (eh) | **ē** (ehh) | picture / yes (casual) |
| **koko** (koh-koh) | **kōko** (kooh-koh) | here / incense |

**How to practice:**
1. Say the short version with one beat per syllable
2. Say the long version, holding the long vowel for two beats
3. **oba-san** (3 beats) vs **o-baa-san** (4 beats)
4. Count on your fingers to make sure you're adding the extra beat

**Common words with long vowels:**
- **arigatō** (ah-ree-gah-tooh) - thank you
- **ohayō** (oh-hah-yooh) - good morning
- **tōkyō** (tooh-kyooh) - Tokyo
- **sūpā** (sooo-paah) - supermarket
- **kōhī** (kooh-heee) - coffee
- **eigo** (ehh-goh) - English
- **onēsan** (oh-nehh-sahn) - older sister
- **sensei** (sen-sehh) - teacher
- **kēki** (kehh-kee) - cake
- **chīzu** (cheee-zoo) - cheese
- **kūkō** (kooo-kooh) - airport
- **yūbinkyoku** (yooo-been-kyoh-koo) - post office

**Practical example:**
- **Kōhī o kudasai** (kooh-heee oh koo-dah-sah-ee) - Coffee please
  - Two long vowels: hold "oh" twice in "kōhī"

### 3. Pitch Accent Basics

Unlike English which uses stress (volume and force), Japanese uses **pitch accent** (high vs low tone). The pitch pattern can change the meaning of words.

**What is pitch accent?**
- Each syllable is pronounced at a HIGH pitch or LOW pitch
- The volume and force stay relatively even
- Pitch patterns are like musical notes: some syllables are "higher" and some are "lower"

**Basic patterns:**
1. **Flat/High**: Start high, stay high → **sakana** (sah-kah-nah) - fish
2. **Head-High**: Start high, drop low → **ame** (ah-meh) - rain
3. **Tail-High**: Start low, rise high → **ame** (ah-meh) - candy
4. **Mid-drop**: Start high, drop, then low → **kokoro** (koh-koh-roh) - heart

#### Minimal Pairs (words that differ only by pitch):

| Word | Pitch Pattern | Meaning |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **hashi** | High-low | chopsticks |
| **hashi** | Low-high | bridge |
| **hashi** | High-high | edge |
| **ame** | High-low | rain |
| **ame** | Low-high | candy |
| **kaki** | High-low | oyster |
| **kaki** | Low-high | persimmon |

**Should you worry about pitch accent as a beginner?**

**Short answer:** Not too much. Focus on the vowels, consonants, and special rules first.

**Why?**
1. Native speakers will understand you from context
2. Pitch accent varies by region (Tokyo vs Osaka have different patterns)
3. It's more important for advanced learners
4. Getting the basic sounds right matters more initially

**However:**
- Be aware it exists
- Listen carefully to native speakers
- Try to mimic the melody/music of what you hear
- When you watch Japanese media, notice the pitch patterns
- As you progress, you can study it more formally

**Practical tip:** Think of Japanese like singing - there's a melody to each phrase. Try to match the melody rather than individual pitches at first.

### 4. Devoicing (Whispered Vowels)

Sometimes the vowels **i** and **u** are devoiced (whispered or almost silent), especially:
- Between voiceless consonants (k, s, t, p, h, f)
- At the end of polite verb forms

**Common examples:**

| Word | Full pronunciation | Natural/Devoiced | Meaning |
|------|-------------------|------------------|---------|
| **desu** | deh-soo | deh-s' (u is silent) | is/am/are |
| **shimasu** | shee-mah-soo | shee-mah-s' (u is silent) | to do |
| **deshita** | deh-shee-tah | deh-sh'tah (i is devoiced) | was |
| **sukiyaki** | soo-kee-yah-kee | s'kee-yah-kee (first u is devoiced) | sukiyaki |
| **sukoshi** | soo-koh-shee | s'koh-shee (u is devoiced) | a little |
| **keshiki** | keh-shee-kee | keh-sh'kee (i is devoiced) | scenery |

**Should you do this?**
- It happens naturally as you get faster at speaking
- Don't worry about it at first - pronounce all vowels fully
- Native speakers will do it automatically
- You might start doing it naturally after hearing a lot of Japanese

## D. COMMON PRONUNCIATION MISTAKES

### Mistakes English Speakers Make

#### 1. **Adding extra vowels where they don't belong**

❌ **Wrong:** "ramen-u" (rah-men-oo)
✅ **Right:** "ramen" (rah-men)

❌ **Wrong:** "des-oo" (deh-soo)
✅ **Right:** "desu" (deh-s' - u is devoiced)

**Fix:** Japanese syllables end in either a vowel or "n" - don't add vowels to the end of words.

---

#### 2. **Saying "L" instead of the Japanese "R" (tap)**

❌ **Wrong:** "arigatou" → "ah-lee-gah-toh"
✅ **Right:** "arigatō" → "ah-ɾee-gah-toh" (tap the R)

❌ **Wrong:** "ramen" → "lamen"
✅ **Right:** "ramen" → "ɾamen" (tap the R)

**Fix:** Tap your tongue lightly behind your upper teeth - it's not "L," not "R," but a single tap.

---

#### 3. **Pronouncing "tsu" as two syllables ("t-su" or "too")**

❌ **Wrong:** "tsunami" → "t-soo-nah-mee" (4 syllables)
✅ **Right:** "tsunami" → "ts-nah-mee" (3 syllables)

❌ **Wrong:** "tsuki" → "t-soo-kee" or "too-kee"
✅ **Right:** "tsuki" → "ts-kee" (2 syllables)

**Fix:** Practice saying "cats" and focus on the "ts" sound. Now add "oo" to it in one beat: "ts-oo."

---

#### 4. **Not pausing for double consonants**

❌ **Wrong:** "matte" → "mah-teh" (sounds like "mate")
✅ **Right:** "matte" → "mah-(pause)-teh" (wait)

❌ **Wrong:** "kitte" → "kee-teh"
✅ **Right:** "kitte" → "kee-(pause)-teh" (stamp)

**Fix:** The small っ is a full beat of silence. Count it!

#### 5. **Not holding long vowels long enough**

❌ **Wrong:** "ohayō" → "oh-hah-yoh" (3 beats)
✅ **Right:** "ohayō" → "oh-hah-yooh" (4 beats - hold the ō)

❌ **Wrong:** "arigatō" → "ah-ree-gah-toh" (4 beats)
✅ **Right:** "arigatō" → "ah-ree-gah-tooh" (5 beats - hold the ō)

**Fix:** Long vowels are TWO beats, not one. Count them!

---

#### 6. **Using English vowel sounds instead of Japanese ones**

❌ **Wrong:** "cat" sound in "arigatō" → "ari-GAT-oh"
✅ **Right:** "father" sound → "ari-GAH-toh"

❌ **Wrong:** "sit" sound in "kitte" → "KIT-teh"
✅ **Right:** "see" sound → "KEET-teh"

**Fix:** Remember the 5 vowels: ah, ee, oo, eh, oh. Always use these sounds.

---

#### 7. **Stressing syllables like in English**

❌ **Wrong:** "a-ri-GA-tō" (stressing "ga")
✅ **Right:** "a-ri-ga-tō" (all syllables equal stress, but with pitch changes)

❌ **Wrong:** "sa-YO-na-ra" (stressing "yo")
✅ **Right:** "sa-yo-na-ra" (even stress)

**Fix:** Give each syllable equal time and force. Japanese is syllable-timed, not stress-timed.

---

#### 8. **Pronouncing "fu" like English "f"**

❌ **Wrong:** "tofu" → "TOF-oo" (upper teeth on lower lip)
✅ **Right:** "tofu" → "TOH-foo" (breathy, rounded lips, no teeth contact)

❌ **Wrong:** "futon" → "FOOT-on"
✅ **Right:** "futon" → "foo-ton" (breathy "f")

**Fix:** Don't let your teeth touch your lip. Blow gently through rounded lips.

---

#### 9. **Forgetting that "u" is often silent in "desu/masu" endings**

❌ **Wrong:** "desu" → "deh-SOO" (pronouncing u fully)
✅ **Right:** "desu" → "deh-s'" (u is devoiced/silent)

❌ **Wrong:** "tabemasu" → "tah-beh-mah-SOO"
✅ **Right:** "tabemasu" → "tah-beh-mah-s'"

**Fix:** In casual/natural speech, the "u" in desu and masu endings is barely audible.

---

#### 10. **Not distinguishing between "n" and "m" sounds before certain consonants**

The standalone "n" (ん) changes pronunciation depending on what comes after it:

- Before **p, b, m** → sounds like "m"
  - **shinbun** → "shim-bun" (newspaper)
  - **kanpai** → "kam-pah-ee" (cheers)
  - **sanma** → "sam-mah" (Pacific saury fish)

- Before **k, g** → sounds like "ng"
  - **ginkou** → "gingkoh" (bank)
  - **sankaku** → "sangkah-koo" (triangle)

- Otherwise → sounds like "n"
  - **sensei** → "sen-say" (teacher)
  - **densha** → "den-shah" (train)

**Fix:** Let the "n" naturally adapt to the following consonant. Don't force it to always sound like "n."

### Summary of Key Pronunciation Tips

✅ **Master the 5 vowels** - they never change
✅ **Tap the R** - don't say L or roll the R
✅ **"Tsu" is one syllable** - practice "cats-oo" → "tsu"
✅ **Pause for small っ** - double consonants need a beat of silence
✅ **Hold long vowels** - they're twice as long (two beats)
✅ **All syllables get equal time** - no stress like in English
✅ **"Fu" is breathy** - no teeth on lip
✅ **Devoice "u" in desu/masu** - it's almost silent
✅ **Don't add extra sounds** - no extra vowels at the end
✅ **Listen and mimic** - match the melody/music you hear

## F. PRONUNCIATION PRACTICE TIPS

### For Self-Study:

1. **Listen actively**
   - Watch Japanese media (anime, dramas, news)
   - Use language learning apps with audio
   - Listen to Japanese music and try to sing along
   - Pay attention to the melody and rhythm

2. **Record yourself**
   - Use your phone to record yourself saying words/phrases
   - Compare to native speaker audio
   - Identify where your pronunciation differs
   - Practice the differences repeatedly

3. **Shadow native speakers**
   - Play audio of a native speaker
   - Repeat immediately after them (like an echo)
   - Try to match their speed, pitch, and rhythm
   - This helps you internalize natural pronunciation

4. **Use minimal pairs**
   - Practice words that differ by only one sound
   - This trains your ear and mouth to distinguish similar sounds
   - Examples: kako/kakkō, obasan/obāsan, hashi (chopsticks)/hashi (bridge)

5. **Slow down**
   - Don't rush when learning
   - Pronounce each syllable clearly and correctly first
   - Speed comes naturally with practice
   - Better to be slow and correct than fast and wrong

6. **Focus on problem sounds**
   - Identify your personal weaknesses (R sound? Tsu? Double consonants?)
   - Dedicate extra time to these specific sounds
   - Practice them in isolation before using them in sentences

7. **Learn by context**
   - Don't just memorize sounds - learn words and phrases
   - Understand what you're saying
   - This makes practice more engaging and memorable

## H. FINAL PRONUNCIATION CHECKLIST

Before moving forward, make sure you can:

- ✅ Pronounce all 5 vowels correctly and consistently
- ✅ Distinguish between short and long vowels
- ✅ Pronounce the Japanese "R" as a tap (not "L" or rolled "R")
- ✅ Say "tsu" as one syllable
- ✅ Say "fu" with a breathy sound (not English "f")
- ✅ Pause correctly for double consonants (small っ)
- ✅ Hold long vowels for two beats
- ✅ Pronounce all syllables with equal stress
- ✅ Say consonant + "y" combinations as one syllable (kya, ryu, etc.)
- ✅ Devoice "u" in "desu" and "masu" endings naturally

**Remember:** Perfect pronunciation comes with time and practice. Don't be afraid to make mistakes—Japanese people appreciate any effort to speak their language. Focus on being understood first, then refine your accent over time.

## Summary

Japanese pronunciation is highly systematic:
- **5 consistent vowels**: a (ah), i (ee), u (oo), e (eh), o (oh)
- **Soft consonants**: Most are similar to English but less forceful
- **Special sounds**: R (tap), tsu (one syllable), fu (breathy)
- **Double consonants**: Add a pause before the consonant
- **Long vowels**: Hold for two beats instead of one
- **Pitch accent**: High and low tones (advanced concept)
- **Equal syllable timing**: No heavy stress like English

With consistent practice and attention to these rules, you'll develop clear, understandable Japanese pronunciation. Good luck, and enjoy learning! がんばって!(Ganbatte! - Do your best!)
