5. Soap and wash your entire body
6. Shampoo and condition hair
7. Rinse thoroughly - all soap must be removed
8. Rinse your stool and put things away neatly
9. Only then enter the bath

**Why It Matters:**

#### Rule 2: No Swimsuits - Completely Nude

**The Rule:**

- Swim fabric can release fibers into water
- Universal rule with almost no exceptions

**Tips:**
- Don't worry - everyone is naked too
- Separate areas for men and women
- Look for: 男 (otoko/men) or 女 (onna/women)
