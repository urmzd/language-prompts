# Guide Generation Checklist (Use Before Delivering)

- **Scope complete:** All top-level sections exist (cover/about, core language patterns, vocab by scenario, emergency/medical, cultural/regional, writing/pronunciation, situational conversations, travel tips, appendices).
- **Tables consistent:** Phrase tables use `English | Script | Transliteration/IPA | Notes` with formality/context labels where helpful.
- **Examples included:** Every pattern or rule has 5+ examples; conversations include translations, cultural notes, and at least one variation.
- **Regional/etiquette noted:** Call out regional differences, do/don't lists, and sensitive topics (payment, gestures, temple/onsen rules).
- **Numbers & measures:** Counters, currency, sizes, and conversions are present and tourist-usable.
- **Navigation aids:** Table of contents, cross-references, and quick-reference sections are present; headings are logically nested.
- **Emergency ready:** Body parts, symptoms, urgent commands, contacts/numbers, and lost/stolen workflows are explicit.
- **Formatting sanity:** No placeholders/TBDs, consistent tone, markdown-safe output, and ready for PDF styling.
